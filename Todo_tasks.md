* [x] Parsing `int`, `bool` and `double` words.
* [x] Parsing `int a , b , c ...`.
* [x] Adding variables to the `symbol_table`.
* [ ] Check before adding variable to `symbol_table` whether it exists or not.
* [ ] Check before assigning value to variable whether it is the same type or not `(double to int)` `(double to bool)`.
* [ ] Before accessing any variable check if it exists in the table.
* [ ] Store the variable datatype in with the variable.
* [ ] Make the above for `double` and `bool`.
* [ ] Check validity of expression evaluation by checking that every variable is the same type.
* [ ] Also you cant use `bool` inside an expression.
* [ ] Make sure that the declaration statements are at the beginning of the program only.
* [ ] Check that you can use the variables especially `bool` inside `if conditions`.
