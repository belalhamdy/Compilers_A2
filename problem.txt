* You are not allowed to use string class, vector, or anything from STL libraries.
* Modify the file original_code.cpp to include 3 data types, int real bool
* real should correspond to "double" in C++.
* All variables MUST be declared at the beginning of the program (example: int x;real y).
* It is possible to use boolean variable inside the if and repeat condition.
* It is not allowed to do arithmetic operations on boolean variables.
* It is allowed to do arithmetic operations on int, real variables such that, in the same expression, all variables are
 of the same type.
* It is not allowed to assign variables of different types.
* All cases not allowed above should produce meaningful compiler error message. You can use exceptions.

* If there is a case not mentioned above, just do whatever you believe it is meaningful.
* Write an input tiny program and include it inside a comment, which contains several test cases (at least 20 statements
 involving variables) that explain its usage and proves correctness of using variables.
* Half the mark is dedicatd to comments explaining the code before each code line (for only the part of the code which
 you added), test cases (at least 20 statements involving operators) that cover a lot of cases, and following the
  CodingStyle.pdf file.
